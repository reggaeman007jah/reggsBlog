## Tools and Services

Arma 3 is a great game, probably the best game I have ever played (and I’ve played a few). Over the years I have built
up an array of additional tools and services that really enhance the experience. Some may be obvious, some might not be
relevant to you, but these do reflect my current platform of supporting tools and services:

SW - Screen Recorder  
If you post things on YouTube, having a screen recorder is pretty essential. But it can be useful for other things too,
such as showing how bugs occur in mods, or demonstrating things to your mates. I use Mirillis Action (for years now);
it cost about ten bucks for a lifetime licence and the product is pretty solid.

SW / HW - TrackIR  
Probably ‘the’ best gameplay enhancer you can leverage. The price has gone up over recent years, but I’d say, until we
get VR, this is the only way to fly/fight. I have used both the wired and wireless versions, and have settled in the wired
version. It does take a bit of getting used to, but very quickly you open up a seriously powerful game enhancer, increasing
your survivability massively!

HW - Good Headphones
I say good - mine are not high end at all, but still get the job done. I have Turtle Beach PX11s (wired). They do actually
get pretty uncomfortable over long sessions, but they deliver pretty well for the most part.

HW - A decent Mouse  
I recently splashed on a new Logitech xxx. My older model had developed some click issues and was eventually unusable for
coding and some gaming. This new model is a total dream machine - highly recommended.

HW - Pedals  
Weirdly, I actually find these come into their own more with infi than with heli flying, enabling leaning around corners.
For me - as I am not using top end pedals - they don’t really give me what I want out of a heli yaw-system, so they will
remain a lean-machine ;)

HW - Joystick with slider controller  
I use a Thrustmaster T1600 - this used to be my main controller and the little slider enables a very nice AFM experience
if that’s your thing. But, since moving to mouse cyclic, I have found a new use for the slider - this is how I get my yaw!

SW - Voice Attack  
You can do so much with this kit, and it is only 10-15 bucks - so worth the money considering the value you get from this.
Not just in Arma but in any PC game. Combining VA with TrackIR is seriously powerful. If you get into voice activated coding,
voice command software is a must.

SW - Team Speak  
Pretty much a standard requirement for online MP play - I have a server with Armahosts. This allows me to be in control of
my server events, as we use TFAR.

SW - FTP / Server Management  
If you are interested in running server events, getting to grips with FTP and a server UI is a must. I use Filezilla.

SW - Video Editor  
I used to use Premiere Pro CS6, but have now migrated to the free and very capable Davinci Resolve.

SW - Code Editor  
If you really want to have fun with Arma, you’ll want to start to tinker with the code to get the results you really want.
I started off with basic old notepad, then notepad++ .. since then I have used a few, but VS Code is - for me - the only
editor in town. It has an SQF plugin too, so you can get a lot of the wiki tips within the editor window.

Service - YouTube  
You’ll want an account to post the results of your editing efforts. Vimeo is also a reasonable alternative, but YouTube is

- for me - easier to use and operate in.

Service - Discord  
Community is such a large part of the Arma experience. Getting into Discord is definitely a wise move - free and generally
no pressure to talk or post anything on servers - you can lurk and learn until you find a group you’re cool with. It is also
easy to set up your own domain for your mates - definitely worth investing time in.

Service - Twitch  
I have an account but tbh don’t stream much. But I would consider it part of the toolkit for any Armaholic.

Additional Knowledge  
There are course more things to learn and master. There is a lot of fun to be had in running your own server games online,
and there you have the challenge of understanding server config. Plus you may want to get into multiplayer scripting (locality!!).
You might also want to set up a new website for your community or mod .. so understanding some basic html and css will enable you
to spin up a basic site from a template. Then you could explore community management - if you have a medium sized group you could
focus your skills in this area.

Arma 3 is such a rich game.. well, it is much more than just a game, and is why 7 years after A3 was released it is still IMHO
the most viable and enjoyable Mil-Sim game out there!!

Peace
